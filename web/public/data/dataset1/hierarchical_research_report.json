              "description": "This hypothesis posits a fundamental and novel regulatory mechanism: that the functional activity of a translational repressor (Rim4) is directly coupled to and stimulated by its amyloid-like assembly, specifically via its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Validating this mechanism would profoundly shift our understanding of protein assembly, demonstrating a beneficial and highly controlled functional role for structures often associated with pathology. It would reveal a new paradigm for post-transcriptional gene regulation where cellular states, potentially signaled by nutrient conditions as suggested by the article title, directly modulate translation by orchestrating protein phase transitions, thereby bridging structural biology with gene expression control. To validate this hypothesis, a multi-pronged experimental approach is necessary. First, in vitro reconstitution experiments using purified Rim4 protein and its variants (e.g., IDR deletion or point mutants, RRM mutants) are crucial to directly assess how IDR-mediated assembly influences RNA binding affinity and specificity, using quantitative biophysical techniques such as fluorescence anisotropy or surface plasmon resonance. Second, in vivo studies in a relevant cellular model system would involve generating Rim4 mutants (e.g., IDR-disrupting mutations, RRM-inactivating mutations) and evaluating their impact on Rim4 assembly state (e.g., via microscopy, cell fractionation), target RNA binding (e.g., RIP-qPCR/seq), and subsequent translational repression of known targets (e.g., using reporter assays or polysome profiling under varying nutrient conditions). This comprehensive approach will establish the causal link between Rim4 assembly, RNA binding, and its physiological function as a translational repressor.",

This challenges the conventional view of retroelements solely as genomic parasites, suggesting they contribute to fundamental physiological processes by orchestrating a potentially programmable system of intercellular communication. Validating this could uncover a previously unrecognized layer of biological regulation, offering new insights into health and disease, and potentially enabling novel therapeutic strategies for targeted nucleic acid delivery. Experimentally, this could be validated by first bioinformatically identifying uncharacterized retroelement-derived proteins with structural similarities to known nucleic acid packaging proteins. Subsequently, in vitro studies would involve expressing these candidate proteins and assessing their ability to package specific reporter RNAs/DNAs into secreted vesicles or directly transfer them to recipient cells in co-culture systems. Further steps would include identifying the endogenous nucleic acid cargo of these proteins using immunoprecipitation and sequencing, and demonstrating their physiological relevance through genetic manipulation (knockout/overexpression) in relevant mammalian cell lines or in vivo models to observe effects on intercellular signaling or cellular phenotypes.

It is currently unknown if viral proteases exploit host steroid hormone receptor pathways, potentially by direct cleavage, to facilitate viral replication or alter host responses. To explore this, we propose to screen retroviral proteases for their capacity to cleave PGR in vitro and in cell culture models, followed by functional assays to determine the impact of such cleavage on PGR-mediated gene expression and, conversely, on retroviral infectivity and spread.",

Validating this mechanism would bridge a critical knowledge gap in the fundamental biology of PNMA2-mediated RNA packaging, directly informing the rational design of next-generation mRNA delivery vehicles with enhanced efficiency, specificity, and safety for gene therapy and vaccine applications. Experimentally validate the hypothesis by reconstituting PNMA2 capsid formation in vitro under various conditions, precisely controlling for RNA presence and concentration. Utilize advanced structural biology techniques such as time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to directly observe the dynamics of PNMA2 disassembly and reassembly in the presence of RNA. Complementary biochemical and biophysical assays, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), can quantify real-time changes in PNMA2 oligomerization and RNA binding, correlating these dynamics with packaging efficiency and cargo integrity.

This insight could fundamentally redefine our understanding of cap-dependent translation regulation, reveal novel layers of gene expression control, and potentially identify new therapeutic targets in pathologies characterized by dysregulated protein synthesis, such as neurodegenerative disorders and certain cancers. To validate this hypothesis, future research should employ comprehensive biochemical reconstitution assays to directly visualize and quantify how purified vertebrate Pumilio impacts the assembly of the eIF4F complex and subsequent 43S pre-initiation complex on capped mRNA templates. This would involve kinetic and equilibrium binding studies, utilizing techniques such as gel shift assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and potentially cryo-electron microscopy to precisely map the molecular interactions and steric hindrance imposed by Pumilio at the 5' cap.",

Develop computational frameworks to model and quantify the contribution of isoform-specific abundance changes to overall gene-level expression dispersion. By integrating isoform quantification with gene-level differential expression analysis, this research will refine our understanding of how fine-grained alternative splicing events impact bulk gene expression statistics, improving the precision of regulatory pathway inference.",

Subsequent functional studies, including targeted perturbations of DAZL's binding motifs on specific mRNA targets and analysis of their stability, translation, and impact on germ cell viability and differentiation, will elucidate the precise mechanisms by which DAZL orchestrates germ cell survival through these interactions.",

The LOBSTR E. coli strain proposes to mitigate this issue through specific genomic modifications in arnA and slyD, purportedly altering the cell surface to reduce common contaminants. Validating the mechanistic link between these precise genomic alterations and the observed contaminant reduction is crucial. This validation would not only confirm the effectiveness of the LOBSTR design but also provide fundamental insights into E. coli outer membrane biology and its impact on protein purification, paving the way for the rational design of next-generation expression hosts tailored for higher purity and yield. To validate that genomic modifications in arnA and slyD are the direct cause of reduced contaminants in LOBSTR, we propose a multi-pronged approach. First, compare the proteomic profiles of His-tag purifications from LOBSTR, its wild-type predecessor (if applicable), and commonly used strains like BL21(DE3) expressing diverse recombinant proteins, quantifying specific contaminant reduction. Second, engineer E. coli BL21(DE3) strains to carry only the arnA modification, only the slyD modification, and both modifications, then assess their purification efficiency and contaminant profiles relative to the LOBSTR strain and parental BL21(DE3). Finally, characterize the alterations in cell surface properties and secreted proteins in these engineered strains using techniques such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics of membrane fractions and spent media, alongside outer membrane vesicle analysis, to directly correlate genomic changes with cellular phenotype and contaminant exclusion mechanisms.",

To validate this hypothesis, we propose a multi-pronged experimental approach. First, aged oocytes (e.g., from aged mice) will be co-cultured with components derived from young follicles, such as young follicular fluid or young granulosa cells, or exposed to conditioned media from young follicular cultures. Oocyte quality parameters, including chromosomal integrity (e.g., spindle morphology, aneuploidy rates), mitochondrial function (e.g., ATP levels, mitochondrial respiration), and epigenetic modifications, will be meticulously assessed post-exposure.

Incorporating functional genomic annotations into association analyses directly addresses these limitations by prioritizing variants with higher prior probability of biological relevance, thereby enhancing the statistical power to detect true associations and providing crucial insights into disease etiology and molecular mechanisms that are otherwise missed by purely statistical approaches. This research proposes to empirically validate the hypothesis by developing and applying a computational framework that systematically integrates multi-omic functional genomics data (e.g., ATAC-seq, Hi-C, eQTLs, histone modifications) into large-scale GWAS cohorts. We will compare the number of novel loci discovered, the strength of associations, and the explained heritability using the functional-informed approach versus conventional GWAS. Further validation will involve fine-mapping key regions and experimentally characterizing the functional impact of prioritized variants on gene expression and cellular phenotypes in relevant in vitro models to demonstrate the biological utility of the enhanced power.",

The high-throughput cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) approach, capable of classifying tens of thousands of complexes to describe domain-level topology, offers a transformative opportunity to systematically map these structural dynamics and identify stable, broadly neutralizing epitopes. We propose leveraging high-throughput Cryo-EM with advanced classification methods (e.g., RELION) to systematically profile the domain-level topological landscape of Hemagglutinin from a broad panel of influenza strains and their complexes with diverse antibody libraries.

The novel ability to resolve PNMA2's structure at high resolution via cryo-EM presents a breakthrough opportunity to identify key structural features and epitopes that drive the autoimmune response, addressing a critical knowledge gap in PNS pathogenesis. Leveraging high-resolution cryo-EM, the proposed direction is to structurally characterize PNMA2, potentially in complex with specific autoantibody fragments or in different conformational states, to precisely map the autoantigenic epitopes responsible for triggering the immune response in paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). This structural understanding will be critical for elucidating the mechanisms of autoimmune targeting and for the rational design of improved diagnostics or immunomodulatory therapies.",

Matrix protein 1 (M1) is an attractive target due to its conservation across influenza strains, but scalable and cost-effective production of conformationally accurate M1-based virus-like particles (VLPs) for vaccine candidates remains a significant hurdle with current systems. The silkworm expression system, known for its high-yield eukaryotic protein production capabilities, offers a promising solution to overcome these limitations. We propose to leverage the silkworm expression system for the high-yield, cost-effective, and scalable production of chimeric M1-based virus-like particles (VLPs). By expressing DDDDK-tagged M1 and/or M1-fusion constructs in silkworms, followed by purification from larval hemolymph, we aim to develop a robust platform for generating high-quality M1 VLPs. These silkworm-derived M1-VLPs can then be rigorously tested as next-generation universal influenza vaccine candidates, addressing the current bottleneck in producing sufficient quantities of highly immunogenic, conserved influenza antigens.",

              "description": "PUM2 is a critical RNA-binding protein implicated in numerous diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer, due to its broad regulatory roles. A major challenge in targeting PUM2 therapeutically is its expansive interaction landscape, making it difficult to pinpoint specific PUM2-target interactions responsible for particular pathological outcomes without inducing widespread off-target effects. Precisely mapping the interaction domains of PUM2 with disease-relevant mRNA or protein partners is crucial for developing targeted therapies. We propose to apply systematic deletion analysis, similar to the method used for the cap interaction domain, to comprehensively map the specific interaction domains and key residues within PUM2 that mediate its binding to a curated set of disease-associated mRNA targets and protein partners. This approach will allow us to identify precise interaction interfaces responsible for PUM2's pathogenic roles, paving the way for the development of highly specific inhibitors that selectively disrupt detrimental interactions without affecting essential physiological functions.",

This project proposes to leverage the targeted downregulation of dArc1 in Drosophila motorneurons using the C380-Gal4 driver with UAS-dArc1-RNAi, coupled with high-resolution FISH, to causally investigate the independent contributions of presynaptic versus postsynaptic dArc1 mRNA localization to motor neuron synaptic integrity and behavioral plasticity, potentially revealing novel targets for motor-related neurological disorders.",

While TEX19.1 is known to be crucial for germline integrity, the specific cis-regulatory elements within its 3' UTR and the trans-acting factors (e.g., DAZL) that govern its expression, stability, and translation are not fully elucidated, hindering targeted interventions. The recent demonstration of site-directed mutagenesis of the Tex19.1 3' UTR to investigate DAZL element cooperation provides an unprecedented opportunity to precisely map these crucial regulatory interactions, offering a breakthrough solution to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying TEX19.1-mediated germline protection. We propose to systematically apply site-directed mutagenesis to the TEX19.1 3' UTR to precisely identify and characterize the specific cis-regulatory elements responsible for its post-transcriptional control by DAZL and other relevant RNA-binding proteins critical for germline health. This involves generating targeted mutations within predicted or known regulatory regions of the TEX19.1 3' UTR in relevant germ cell models and subsequently assessing the impact on TEX19.1 mRNA stability, translational efficiency, and protein expression. By thoroughly dissecting these regulatory mechanisms, this research aims to uncover how precise TEX19.1 regulation maintains germline integrity and how its disruption contributes to reproductive disorders, paving the way for potential therapeutic strategies.",

While binding sites can be mapped, directly linking RBP loss to changes in mRNA abundance, and thus functional regulation, in specific cell types is crucial. The proposed method, leveraging fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and RNA-seq to identify mRNAs sensitive to RBP deletion, provides an elegant solution by enabling the precise identification of functionally regulated mRNAs within defined cellular populations. To address the critical gap in understanding RBP function in neurodegenerative diseases, this methodology could be applied to identify specific mRNA targets of disease-associated RBPs, such as TDP-43 or FUS. By generating cell models or utilizing in vivo systems where specific neuronal populations can be isolated via FACS, followed by RNA-seq upon conditional deletion or knockdown of the RBP, we can precisely map the entire repertoire of mRNAs whose stability or expression is directly sensitive to the RBP's presence.

Understanding this layer of regulation is crucial for explaining forms of meiotic dysfunction where TEX11 mRNA levels are seemingly normal yet protein function is aberrant. Apply 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)-luciferase reporter assays and polysome profiling to systematically identify and characterize novel trans-acting factors (e.g., specific microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins) that interact with the TEX11 3'UTR to modulate its translational efficiency in human germline stem cells and primary spermatocytes.

We propose to apply 3'UTR-luciferase reporter assays and polysome profiling, previously used to investigate SMC1B regulation, to analyze its post-transcriptional control in human germline cells from individuals experiencing unexplained meiotic arrest or recurrent aneuploidy.

Current methods using global knockouts do not precisely delineate neuronal-specific contributions from potential developmental or extra-neuronal effects. This novel approach, involving targeted dArc1 transgene expression in neurons within a dArc1 mutant background, offers a precise tool to confirm that neuronal DARC1 alone is sufficient for normal synaptic function and complex behaviors. This will provide a clearer understanding of its cell-specific contributions and inform targeted therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.",

A critical challenge remains in understanding how these genetic alterations translate into specific circuit-level dysfunctions that drive the diverse behavioral and cognitive deficits observed in patients, hindering the development of targeted therapies. The availability of *Shank3* mutant mice provides an invaluable *in vivo* platform to precisely map these circuit abnormalities and test interventions within a relevant physiological context, moving beyond the limitations of cellular models. Utilize *Shank3* mutant mice to systematically identify and characterize specific aberrant neural circuit activities and synaptic dysfunctions underlying core behavioral phenotypes (e.g., social deficits, repetitive behaviors) through advanced neurophysiological (e.g., *in vivo* electrophysiology, optogenetics) and imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI, calcium imaging).

We propose to rigorously apply in vivo genetic ablation, specifically conditional or inducible PEG10 knockout mouse models, to definitively ascertain the essential oncogenic roles of PEG10 in established cancer contexts such as hepatocellular carcinoma or breast cancer.

A method to specifically damage or degrade this persistent viral DNA reservoir within infected cells is a major unmet need for achieving a functional cure. We propose to engineer chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) to specifically target HBV-infected hepatocytes. These VLPs would encapsulate or be conjugated with doxorubicin, enabling the precise delivery of a DNA-intercalating agent to disrupt the persistent cccDNA minichromosome, thereby offering a novel strategy to eliminate the viral reservoir and achieve a functional cure for chronic HBV infection.",

Traditional methods often struggle with inter-sample variability, low read counts, and the need to normalize data across vastly different expression landscapes, frequently leading to masked true signals or spurious findings. The novel rlog transformation, by fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) with a baseline and computing shrunken log-fold changes with empirical Bayes, offers a powerful statistical solution to robustly stabilize variance and precisely estimate gene expression shifts, even in the presence of high noise and variability. Apply the GLM-based rlog transformation and empirical Bayes-shrunken log-fold changes to resolve the challenge of identifying consistent gene expression biomarkers in highly variable human disease cohorts. This method would be particularly valuable for uncovering subtle, but critical, prognostic or diagnostic gene signatures in diseases characterized by significant patient heterogeneity or complex disease progression (e.g., neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases, or specific cancer subtypes), where current differential expression methods often yield inconsistent results due to high noise and inter-individual differences.",

Current fine-mapping approaches often yield multiple candidate SNPs, hindering functional validation. Integrating functional genomic annotations is crucial, but methods need to robustly account for LD while assessing functional enrichment. We propose to apply stratified LD score regression, which computes the expected chi-squared statistic of each SNP based on the functional annotations it tags, to re-analyze large-scale GWAS datasets for complex human diseases. By stratifying SNPs based on diverse functional annotations (e.g., enhancer regions, promoter motifs, coding sequences, non-coding regulatory elements), this method will enable the identification of specific functional categories and individual SNPs within LD blocks that are most enriched for disease associations. This approach will provide a systematic framework for prioritizing truly causal variants for downstream functional characterization, thereby accelerating our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic target identification.",

Traditional methods often rely on exogenous gene overexpression or broad chemical treatments, which can introduce artifacts or lack specificity. CRISPR activation offers a precise tool to upregulate endogenous genes, providing a more physiologically relevant approach to drive desired cellular states. Investigate the application of CRISPR activation to specifically induce the expression of key endogenous proneural genes (e.g., Neurog2, Ascl1, Dcx) in N2a cells.

We propose leveraging DESeq2's adaptive variance estimation strategy, which selectively uses the gene-wise estimate when it deviates significantly from the shrunken estimate, to identify genes with true extreme biological variability. This approach should be applied to transcriptomic datasets derived from heterogeneous clinical samples, such as early-stage tumors or complex neurological disorders, where critical gene expression changes may occur only within specific, often rare, cell populations or disease subsets.

Current biochemical methods often lack the spatial resolution or sensitivity for transient interactions. Leveraging advanced fluorescence microscopy could provide unprecedented insights into RASSF interaction dynamics and subcellular localization. To address the challenge of identifying novel, functional RASSF interaction partners and understanding their spatial dynamics, we propose adapting the co-transfection of fluorescently tagged RASSF (e.g., RFP-RASSF1A) with GFP-tagged candidate proteins of interest, followed by live-cell fluorescence microscopy, potentially incorporating FRET or BiFC techniques. This approach would allow for direct visualization of RASSF-partner co-localization and direct interaction in different cellular states (e.g., normal vs. cancerous, stressed vs. unstressed), enabling the discovery of novel pathways regulated by RASSF and identifying specific interactions crucial for its tumor-suppressive activity.",

Site-directed mutagenesis of specific 3' UTR elements provides the precision needed to dissect these crucial cooperative interactions. We propose to utilize site-directed mutagenesis of the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of known and candidate DAZL mRNA targets implicated in germ cell differentiation and maintenance. By systematically altering specific DAZL binding motifs and their cooperative regulatory elements within these 3' UTRs, we can precisely evaluate the impact on mRNA stability, translational efficiency, and ultimately, germ cell fate and viability in cellular or in vivo models. This will allow for the identification of critical cooperative regulatory nodes whose disruption directly underlies DAZL-associated infertility.",

This controlled RASSF1A deficiency model will then be used to systematically screen for altered sensitivity to standard chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies, coupled with pathway analysis to identify specific molecular pathways (e.g., apoptosis, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation) that become dysregulated upon RASSF1A loss, thereby revealing novel targets for overcoming chemoresistance.",

We propose to apply the targeted disruption of the cytoplasmic actin network using Cytochalasin D, as demonstrated in oocytes, to epithelial cancer cell models.
